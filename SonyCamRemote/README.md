** SONY CAM REMOTE CONTROL **
=============================

Required hardware: Sony As/20 & ESP8266 

This program is used as interval trigger for the Sony AS/20 action camera.
Because the built-in interval trigger only captures low-res images.
With remote control (via WIFI) it is possible to make HI-RES interval images at maximum
resolution of the camera. 

The software is in the "user" folder. The rest is other required stuff like libraries and includefiles.
